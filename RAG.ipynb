              "Document(metadata={'source': '/content/11 stories.pdf', 'page': 10}, page_content='9\\n In the town of Vladimir lived a young merchant \\nnamed Ivan Dmitrich Aksionov. He had two shops and \\na house of his own.\\n Aksionov was a handsome, fair-haired, curly-\\nheaded fellow, full of fun, and very fond of singing. \\nWhen quite a young man he had been given to drink, \\nand was riotous when he had had too much; but after \\nhe married he gave up drinking, except now and then.\\n One summer Aksionov was going to the Nizhny \\nFair, and as he bade good-bye to his family, his wife said \\nto him, “Ivan Dmitrich, do not start to-day; I have had \\na bad dream about you.”\\n Aksionov laughed, and said, “You are afraid \\nthat when I get to the fair I shall go on a spree.”\\n His wife replied: “I do not know what I am \\nafraid of; all I know is that I had a bad dream. I dreamt \\nyou returned from the town, and when you took off \\nyour cap I saw that your hair was quite grey.”\\n Aksionov laughed. “That’s a lucky sign,” said \\nhe. “See if I don’t sell out all my goods, and bring you \\nsome presents from the fair.”\\n So he said good-bye to his family, and drove away. \\nWhen he had travelled half-way, he met a merchant \\nwhom he knew, and they put up at the same inn for the \\nnight. They had some tea together, and then went to \\nbed in adjoining rooms.\\n It was not Aksionov’s habit to sleep late, and, \\nwishing to travel while it was still cool, he aroused his \\ndriver before dawn, and told him to put in the horses.\\n Then he made his way across to the landlord of \\nthe inn (who lived in a cottage at the back), paid his bill, \\nand continued his journey.\\n When he had gone about twenty-five miles, he \\nstopped for the horses to be fed. Aksionov rested awhile \\nin the passage of the inn, then he stepped out into the \\nporch, and, ordering a samovar to be heated, got out his \\nguitar and began to play.\\n Suddenly a troika drove up with tinkling bells \\nand an official alighted, followed by two soldiers. He \\ncame to Aksionov and began to question him, asking \\nhim who he was and whence he came. Aksionov \\nanswered him fully, and said, “Won’t you have some \\ntea with me?” But the official went on cross-questioning \\nhim and asking him. “Where did you spend last night? \\nWere you alone, or with a fellow-merchant? Did you see \\nthe other merchant this morning? Why did you leave \\nthe inn before dawn?”\\n Aksionov wondered why he was asked all these \\nquestions, but he described all that had happened, and \\nthen added, “Why do you cross-question me as if I were \\na thief or a robber? I am travelling on business of my \\nown, and there is no need to question me.”\\n Then the official, calling the soldiers, said, “I \\nam the police-officer of this district, and I question you \\nbecause the merchant with whom you spent last night \\nhas been found with his throat cut. We must search \\nyour things.”\\n They entered the house. The soldiers and \\nthe police-officer unstrapped Aksionov’s luggage and \\nsearched it. Suddenly the officer drew a knife out of a \\nbag, crying, “Whose knife is this?”\\n Aksionov looked, and seeing a blood-stained \\nknife taken from his bag, he was frightened.\\n “How is it there is blood on this knife?”\\n Aksionov tried to answer, but could hardly \\nutter a word, and only stammered: “I--don’t know--not \\nmine.” Then the police-officer said: “This morning the \\nmerchant was found in bed with his throat cut. You are \\nthe only person who could have done it. The house was \\nlocked from inside, and no one else was there. Here is \\nthis blood-stained knife in your bag and your face and \\nmanner betray you! Tell me how you killed him, and \\nhow much money you stole?”\\n Aksionov swore he had not done it; that he had \\nnot seen the merchant after they had had tea together; \\nthat he had no money except eight thousand rubles of \\nhis own, and that the knife was not his. But his voice \\nwas broken, his face pale, and he trembled with fear as \\nthough he went guilty.\\n The police-officer ordered the soldiers to bind \\nAksionov and to put him in the cart. As they tied his \\nfeet together and flung him into the cart, Aksionov \\ncrossed himself and wept. His money and goods were \\ntaken from him, and he was sent to the nearest town \\nand imprisoned there. Enquiries as to his character \\nwere made in Vladimir. The merchants and other \\ninhabitants of that town said that in former days he \\nused to drink and waste his time, but that he was a \\nGOD SEES THE TRUTH, BUT WAITS\\nby Leo Tolstoy')"

But instead of finding you, I came across your \\nattendants, who recognized me, giving me this wound. \\nLuckily, I escaped and ran here. If I hadn’t met you I \\nwould surely be dead by now. I had intended to kill \\nyou, but instead you saved my life! I am ashamed and \\ngrateful beyond words. If I live, I vow to be your servant \\nfor the rest of my life, and I will bid my children and \\ngrandchildren to do the same.

He not only \\nforgave the man but promised to return all the man’s \\nproperty and to send his own physician and servants to \\nwait on the man until he was completely healed. After \\nordering his attendants to take the man home, the \\nemperor returned to see the hermit. Before returning \\nto the palace the emperor wanted to repeat his three \\nquestions one last time. He found the hermit sowing \\nseeds in the earth they had dug the day before.\\n The hermit stood up and looked at the emperor. \\n“But your questions have already been answered.”\\n “How’s that?” the emperor asked, puzzled.\\n “Yesterday, if you had not taken pity on my age \\nand given me a hand with digging these beds, you would \\nhave been attacked by that man on your way home. \\nThen you would have deeply regretted not staying \\nwith me. Therefore the most important time was the \\ntime you were digging in the beds, the most important \\nperson was myself, and the most important pursuit \\nwas to help me. Later, when the wounded man ran up \\nhere, the most important time was the time you spent \\ndressing his wound, for if you had not cared for him he \\nwould have died and you would have lost the chance \\nto be reconciled with him. Likewise, he was the most \\nimportant person, and the most important pursuit was \\ntaking care of his wound. Remember that there is only \\none important time and is Now.

Who \\nare the most important people to work with?

Many who read \\nthe decree made their way to the palace at once, each \\nperson with a different answer.\\n In reply to the first question, one person advised \\nthat the emperor make up a thorough time schedule, \\nconsecrating every hour, day, month, and year for \\ncertain tasks and then follow the schedule to the letter. \\nOnly then could he hope to do every task at the right \\ntime.\\n Another person replied that it was impossible \\nto plan in advance and that the emperor should put \\nall vain amusements aside and remain attentive to \\neverything in order to know what to do at what time.\\n Someone else insisted that, by himself, the \\nemperor could never hope to have all the foresight and \\ncompetence necessary to decide when to do each and \\nevery task and what he really needed was to set up a \\nCouncil of the Wise and then to act according to their \\nadvice.\\n Someone else said that certain matters required \\nimmediate decision and could not wait for consultation, \\nbut if he wanted to know in advance what was going to \\nhappen he should consult magicians and soothsayers.\\n The responses to the second question also \\nlacked accord.\\n One person said that the emperor needed \\nto place all his trust in administrators, another \\nurged reliance on priests and monks, while others \\nrecommended physicians. Still others put their faith in \\nwarriors.\\n The third question drew a similar variety of \\nanswers. Some said science was the most important \\npursuit. Others insisted on religion.
